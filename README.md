# Pairs Trading Strategy with a Machine Learning Approach

## Introduction
This thesis explores the enhancement of pairs trading strategy by comparing traditional statistical models with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks. The focus is on pairs trading within the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), utilizing cointegration to identify potential pairs.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Historical stock prices of DJIA components were collected and preprocessed.
2. **Pairs Selection Using Cointegration Analysis**: Potential pairs were identified using the Engle-Granger Test for cointegration.
3. **Modeling and Forecasting**:
   - **ARMA Model**: Used for traditional statistical forecasting.
   - **LSTM Neural Networks**: Employed for advanced pattern recognition and forecasting.
4. **Training and Validation**: Both models were trained on historical data and validated.
5. **Backtesting the Strategy**: Performance was evaluated using historical data.

## Results
The thesis found that while both models had their merits, LSTM Neural Networks demonstrated superior performance in capturing complex patterns and adapting to changing market conditions.

## Conclusion
Integrating machine learning, particularly LSTM Neural Networks, into pairs trading strategies can significantly enhance performance compared to traditional methods.
